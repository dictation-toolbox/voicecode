    the stack).  The interface is modeled on the command history of
    Unix tcsh.  The user can move backwards and forwards through the
    command_stack.  Any partially edited command-line is stored when the
    user first moves back into the stack and restored if the user moves
    forward past the most recent command.  The previous commands may be
    edited, but these changes are lost when the user moves in either
