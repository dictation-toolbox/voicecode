    provided only for compatibility with ServerSingleThread.  All other
    servers should be set up so that listen_msgr avoids blocking and 
    simply return None if there are no messages.

    BOOL *closing* -- flag indicating that the external editor has
    told us it is disconnecting, or the listen socket connection has
    been broken, or the AppMgr has called cleanup

    open buffers?

    bidirectional selection (cursor can be at either end of the
    selection)

    shareable window (i.e. a shell window where the editor can be
    suspended or closed without closing the window)

    windows?

    safe to query the editor to see if it is active, or whether doing so
    when the editor is inactive will block

    BOOL *activity_state* -- an internal flag to keep track of whether
    the editor process is active or suspended

    BOOL *query_active* -- if false, the activity_state is accurate, and
    we should use it to respond to is_active.  If true, we instead 
    query the editor
