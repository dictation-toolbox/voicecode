    phrases for those symbols to the Speech Recognition system's vocabulary.

    Also has methods for matching a pseudo symbol to a native symbol
    (e.g. "a new symbol" -> aNewSym)

    **INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES**

    *CmdInterp interp* -- reference to the parent CmdInterp

    *{STR:* [SymbolInfo] *)}* symbol_info={} -- Dictionary of known
     symbols. Key is the native written form of the symbol and the
     value is the information about that symbol.

    *WordTrie* spoken_form_info -- WordTrie data structure which maps
     spoken forms to written forms of known symbols.

    *{STR: 1}* tentative_symbols -- set of symbols which have been added
    tentatively, but will be removed if the user undoes or corrects the 
    utterance containing them, or re-formats them.  The keys are the
    native written forms of the tentative symbols.  Tentative symbols
    become permanent when they are inserted by re-formatting, or when
    the user exists the mediator.

    *{STR: [STR]}* abbreviations -- Dictionary of preferred
     abbreviations for words.  The key is the word, and the value is a
     prioritized list of abbreviations

    *{STR: [STR]}* alt_abbreviations -- Dictionary of alternative
     abbreviations to be used as additional suggestions in the sing
     symbol reformatting dialog, but not as the first choice in initial
     dictation of new symbols.  The key is the word, and the value is a
     prioritized list of abbreviations.  The inverse of this mapping is 
     also used to generate expansions for abbreviations in symbols 
     scanned from existing code.  In fact, that is the primary purpose
     of the alternative abbreviations, but they are stored in the
     inverse form because the order of abbreviations for a given word is
     significant in the reformatting dialog, whereas the order of
     expansions for a given abbreviations is not.

    *{STR: [STR]}* pronunciations -- dictionary of pronunciations for
    abbreviated words.  These pronunciations are used to generate
    expansions for components of known symbols, but not
    abbreviations.  For example, we might want to tell the mediator to
    use 'deaf' in the spoken form of a symbol containing the word 'def',
    but wouldn't want 'deaf' to be abbreviated as 'def' in new symbols.

    *{STR: INT}* acronyms -- set of acronyms which should be expanded
    when seen as components of known symbols

    *{STR: [STR]}* extra_expansions={} -- Dictionary of
     extra expansions added manually.

    *{STR: [STR]}* expansions={} -- Dictionary of
     expansions of abbreviations. The key is the abbreviation and 
     the value is a list of possible expansions.  This dictionary is
     generated by combining the inverses of abbreviations and
     alt_abbreviations with the expansions generated from
     pronunciations, acronyms, and extra expansions.

    *{STR: {STR: 1}}* unresolved_abbreviations={} -- Dictionary of
     unresolved abbreviations. These are abbreviations that have
     appeared in at least one compiled symbol, yet are neither a word
     in the speech vocabulary or a known abbreviation. Values are
     dictionnaries that list the symbols containing the unresolved
     abbreviation.

    *{STR: STR}* _cached_symbols_as_one_string -- Caches the last value
     returned by method [symbols_as_one_string] for each initial letter.
     A value of *None* indicates that the string needs to be regenerated by
     [symbols_as_one_string].

    *{STR: {STR: 1}* _symbols_starting_with -- Caches the written forms of
    all symbols starting with a given letter as a set

    *[STR] standard_symbol_sources* -- List of files in which standard
    symbols for different languages are defined.

    *[STR] symbol_sources_read* -- List of files from which standard
    symbols have already been scanned.

    *[STR] abbrev_sources* -- List of files in which
    abbreviations and expansions for symbol terms are defined.

    *STR* sym_file = None -- Name of the file used to store those SymDict 
    attributes which should be persistent.  If *None*
    it means the object should never be saved to/read from file.

    *STR* export_file -- name of the default file to which
    abbreviations are exported (without the trailing .py, so that we can
    append .on_init)

    *BOOL* from_file -- true if the symbol dictionary was successfully
    loaded from a file

    *INT* file_time -- if from_file is true, contains the time of last 
    modification of the symbol dictionary file (in seconds since the
    epoch, as returned by os.stat).  Otherwise, file_type is None.

    [SB_ServiceLang] *lang_name_srv* -- Service used by SymDict to
    determine a buffer's programming language.
    
    [INT] *min_chars_for_approx_match=4* -- Minimum number of characters that a
    native symbol must have in order to be matched approximately to a
    pseudo symbol. Very short symbols tend to cause too many false positive
    matches, and in any case, they are easy to dictate by spelling (in fact
    the easiest way to dictate a short symbol is to spell it).
    
    [INT] *min_non_consec_chars_for_approx_match=3* -- minimum number of
    characters from each word which must appear in a word of a native
    symbol, unless the word of the native symbol is a prefix of the
    spoken word

    [INT] *min_chars_run_together=3* -- Minimum number of characters
    for each run-together word that an abbreviation found by match_pseudo_symbol
    must have in order to be accepted as an approximate match to a
    pseudo symbol. 
   
    [INT] *max_auto_acronym=3* -- Maximum number of characters
    in one word of a symbol for us to automatically generate an acronym
    as part of the expanded forms

    *{STR: [STR]} weak_pairs* -- pairs of weak and strong consonants
     such that the first member of the pair is often dropped from a
     symbol while the second is retained.  The keys are the weak
     consonants, and the value is the list of strong consonants
     associated with each weak consonant.

    *FLOAT match_threshold* -- minimum confidence level required of an
    approximate symbol match

    *FCT BOOL(STR, STR) word_exists* -- alternative function to use to
    check whether a word exists, or None to use self.std_word_exists.
    Used only in regression testing, to standardize behavior across
    different versions of the speech engine vocabulary
   
    CLASS ATTRIBUTES**

    *{STR: * [LangDef] *}* language_definitions={} -- Key is the name
     of a language and the value is a language definition object which
     defines rules for parsing symbols in that language.
