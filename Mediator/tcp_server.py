    """Abstract base class for the main thread of a TCP/IP based 
    VoiceCode server.

    ServerMainThread will launch several other threads:
    
    ListenNewEditorsThread listens for new editors to connect on the
    VC_LISTEN port.  It puts the new socket on the new_listen_socks
    Queue, and notifies ServerMainThread through a InterThreadEvent.
    This event will ensure that handshake_listen_socks is called to do
    the initial handshaking.  Once the listen socket has completed
    the initial handshaking, handshake_listen_socks appends it to the 
    pending_listen_socks list.  The editor will then open a 
    
    NewConnListThread listens for the talker connections on the VC_TALK
    port.  It appends the new socket to the new_talk_socks list and 
    notifies ServerMainThread through a InterThreadEvent.  This event
    will ensure that handshake_talk_socks is called.
    handshake_talk_socks will go through the new_talk_socks list and
    pair them up with the elements of the pending_listen_socks with
    matching IDs, and will call package_sock_pair.  
    
    package_sock_pair will create a ListenAndQueueMsgsThread to listen 
    for data on the listen_sock and queue complete messages.  
    package_sock_pair will also create an instance of a subclass of 
    AppStateMessaging, with a MixedMessenger which sends messages 
    directly on the talk_sock, but reads them from this queue.  
    The LAQM Thread also notifies ServerMainThread using a
    SocketHasDataEvent.  This event will ensure that
    process_ready_socks is called, which will call
    listen_one_transaction on the appropriate AppStateMessaging.
    AppStateMessaging will also get messages from the editor off of the
    queue when it synchronizes with the editor at recognition starting

    The communication between the subsidiary threads and the main
    thread requires the event objects described above and a message loop 
    which receives messages from these event objects and calls the proper 
    ServerMainThread methods.  Some subclasses of ServerMainThread
    (ServerOldMediatorWin32Evt) supply these events themselves, and 
    have an internal message loop.  Others require an external object,
    which owns ServerMainThread (directly or indirectly), to supply the 
    event objects and the message loop.  the events to be 
    
    This flexibility means that ServerMainThread relies on
    virtual functions to create the subsidiary threads.
