    """abstract base class for frames for GenEdit

    Note: to destroy a GenEditFrame, its owner must call the 
    cleanup method (inherited from OwnerObject), followed by close_window.  
    The reason for this is that some signals to close the frame are 
    sent as callbacks from the frame to the GenEditFrames object 
    which owns it.  Separating the call to clean up the generic frame
    from the call to destroy the GUI frame allows us to let the function
    making the callback close the frame when the callback returns, while
    still allowing an exit callback to close all frames.
