"""interfaces for editor buffers with change notification.

TextBuffer is an abstract interface which is used
as a wrapper around various text/edit controls, usually either visible 
(GUI) text controls or hidden (speech) edit controls like the VDct.
 
It is a fairly simple, lightweight interface.  You can find the length
of the buffer.  You can set/get the text.  You can set/get the
selection.  That's about it.
 
Various subclasses add additional functionality, such as notification or
specification of changes.  Also, there are other abstract add-in classes
which add specific functionality (get_visible for VisibleBuffer,
activate for SpeechBuffer, set_visible for SelectionBuffers).  In order
to allow the user to mix and match these additional functionality
without running into problems with multiple inheritance due to
ambiguity, these add-in classes are not derived from TextBuffer,
although it doesn't make much sense to create a concrete class which
inherits from VisibleBuffer and not from TextBuffer (or a subclass of
TextBuffer).
 
Then there are concrete subclasses, like TextBufferWX which implements
TextBufferChangeSpecify and VisibleBuffer using a wxTextCtrl, or
VoiceDictBuffer which implements TextBufferChangeSpecify,
SpeechBufferRecogStart, LockableSpeechBuffer, and SelectionBuffer using the
natlink.DictObj."""
