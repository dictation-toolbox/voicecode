    **INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES**

    [Messenger] *underlying* -- underlying messenger (usually
    [MessengerBasic]) used to receive and unpack them messages.

    Queue.Queue *completed_msgs* -- Queue on which to deposit the
    completed messages.

    SocketHasDataEvent *event* -- object used to notify the main thread
    that a socket has data

    Event *connection_ending* -- threading.Event object which will be set
    to true if the connection has been terminated and the thread should die


    (STR, {STR: STR}) conn_broken_msg -- message to put onto the Queue to 
    indicate that the connection was broken unexpectedly.  Note that
    because of thread timing issues, this can occur even if the
    mediator previously received an editor_disconnecting message, or
    even if the editor disconnected in response to a
    mediator_closing or terminating message.  However, in the former case, 
    AppStateMessaging should process the editor_disconnecting message
    first, and will therefore ignore any subsequent messages in the
    queue (including the conn_broken one).  In the latter case, the mediator 
    should already have left the message loop, so, again, the
    conn_broken message should not be processed.
