    """Interface to the programming environment.    

    Implements methods for manipulating and querying a programming
    environment that is being driven by VoiceCode.

    This is mostly a virtual class providing an abstract interface to
    the programming environment.

    But some of the methods implement concrete behaviour such as:
    
    - managing the history of voice commands for that programming
      environement

    - dispatching certain methods to an appropriate source buffer
      (implemented as an instance of [SourceBuff]).

    **INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES**
    
    *STR app_name=None* -- name of the programming environment
    
    *[(STR,* [Context], [Action]*) *] history=[]* -- Array of recent
    commands that have been executed. Each is entry is a 2ple. The first
    entry is the context in which the command was applied. The second
    entry is the action that was executed.
    
    *{STR: * [SourceBuff] *} open_buffers={}* -- List of source
     buffers that are currently open in the programming
     environment. The key is the buffer name (not necessarily 
     the file name!) and the value is the [SourceBuff] object.
    
    *INT* max_history=100 --  Maximum length of the command history.

    *BOOL* alive -- flag indicating whether an external editor is still
    connected (cleared to signal SimCmdsObj.say that a results callback
    failed because the editor had disconnected unexpectedly)

    *BOOL* translation_is_off -- If true, then translation of CSCs and
     LSAs isturned off for that applications. Everything should be
     typed as dictated text, except for commands that turn the
     translation back on (NOT IMPLEMENTED FOR NOW).

    *BOOL* print_buff_when_changed=0 -- If true, then print the content
    of the current buffer whenever it changes (used mostly for regression
    testing external editor).

    *AppCbkHandler* manager -- the AppCbkHandler object which handles
    callbacks from this AppState (and is usually its owner).

    Certain callback methods (close_app_cbk, new_buffer_cbk) will notify 
    the manager.  If we are using the old mediator infrastructure, manager 
    may be None.  Therefore, AppState must check whether manager == None
    before sending such notifications.

    *STR* instance_name -- the name of this editor instance, assigned by
    the manager, and used to identify the editor in callbacks to the manager.

    *STR* bound_buffer_name=None -- Name of the buffer that VoiceCode
    is currently bound to operate on. If *None*, use editor's active
    buffer. See [curr_buffer_name] method for a description of buffer
    binding.

    *FCT* change_callback --
    change_callback( *INT* start, *INT* end, *STR* text, 
    *INT* selection_start, *INT* selection_end, 
    *STR* buff_name, *BOOL* program_initiated).   See set_change_callback
