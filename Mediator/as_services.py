"""Support services for [AppState] subclasses.

This module defines a series of services that can be used by various
[AppState] subclasses to implement concrete methods.

The concrete behaviour is factored into services as opposed to being
implemented directly as methods of [AppState] subclasses. This is to
allow more flexible mixin of implementation of behaviours than can be
supported through subclassing.

For example, class AppStateX may need to implement some methods like
class AppStateY, but other methods like class AppStateZ. With
subclassing, AppStateX would have to derive from both AppStateY and
AppStateZ, which means that either AppStateY would have to derive from
AppStateZ or vice-versa (can't use multiple inheritance to make
AppStateX inherit from both AppStateY and AppStateZ because that would
result in method name clashes). But maybe AppStateY and AppStateZ need
to be on different branches of the inheritance hierarchy.

By implementing variants of a given methods as variants of a given
service, we make it possible for two classes to use the same variant
of a method even if they are not on the same branch of the inheritance
hierarchy. Without such an approach, the code implementing that
variant would have to be cloned and copied to the two classes.
