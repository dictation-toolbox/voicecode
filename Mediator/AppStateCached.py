    """Interface optimised for editors that communicate with VoiceCode
    through a slow link.

    In order to minimise communication between VoiceCode and the
    editor, *AppStateCached* keeps a local copy of the state of the
    editor. This avoids having to query the editor for the same
    information all the time.

    Methods in *AppStateCached* assume that:

    - The cached information will be synchronised with the editor's
      state at the beginning of every utterance.

    - *AppStateCached* methods that affect the state of the editor
      *directly* (that is, without going through an other [AppState]
      or [SourceBuff] method) will synchronize the cache before
      exiting.

    For any method *readingMethod* that reads the state of the
    external editor, *AppStateCached* implements two methods:

    *readingMethod* -- This is the public method (usually a method of
     [AppState]) used to read the state. It usually just checks if
     value is cached, and if so, reads it from cache. If value is not
     cached, it retrieves it from the external editor an caches it.

    *_readingMethod_from_app* -- This is a private method which reads
     the state directly from the external editor. Such methods are not
     expected to save the read state to cache (this will done by
     [synchronize_with_app] method).

    For any method *writingMethod* that changes the state of the
    external editor, *AppStateCached* implements two methods:

    *writingMethod* -- This is the public method. It does the change
     on the external editor (i.e. invoke *_writingMethod_from_app*)
     and then synchronises the cache with the external editor.

    *_writingMethod_from_app* -- This is a private method that just
     effects the change on the external editor, without synchronizing
     the cache.

# the application.  That way, this information will be uncached except 
# for those buffers for which the application explicitly
