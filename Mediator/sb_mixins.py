        store_current_state returns a "cookie" which can be passed to
        restore_state or compare_with_current.  The type and attributes
        of the cookie will depend on the specific subclass of
        SourceBuff.  In the most straightforward implementation, it 
        may include a copy of the entire contents of the
        buffer and the selection.  In other cases, particularly when the
        editor or SourceBuff provides an internal undo stack, it may simply be a
        reference to a point in this stack.
        
        Important Notes:
        
        You should only pass the cookie to methods of
        the SAME SourceBuff object from which it came.  Generally,
        cookies can not be pickled and retrieved.

        The type of cookie will vary with the concrete subclass 
        of SourceBuff.  The corresponding class object is 
        returned by _state_cookie_class.  However, external callers
        should not depend on the type, attributes, or methods 
        of the cookie.

        This method does not synchronize with the editor prior to
