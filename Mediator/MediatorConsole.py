      - coordinating the content of the various fields of the view 
        so that they are always in sync
      - requesting the view to simulate user events (for regression
        testing)

    By convention, any method whose name looks like do_X, is a method
    which is meant to programmatically simulate user action X. Any
    method whose name looks like on_X is a method which is invoked
    when the user does action X.
