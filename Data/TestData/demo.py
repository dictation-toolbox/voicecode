command pane:

execfile('demo.py')

and then using up/down arrows to navigate through the command history.

Make sure that:

- you are in directory 'Data/TestData'
- do File.Open and open 'Data/TestData/large_buff.py' (this makes sure you
 are in the correct directory and also makes sure that symbols for that file
 have been compiled)
