    testing, and even then, the persistent mediator object should

    dialog/prompt during regression testing, with both persistent
    and temporary mediator objects.

    as a server, and for invoking the correction dialog boxes.  May be
    None if the mediator is not running in GUI mode

    subclass of WavePlayback, or None if no playback is available

    testing mode, test_space is the namespace in which regression tests
